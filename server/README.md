### POST /start
This api starts an agent with given graph and override properties. The started agent will join into the specified channel, and subscribe to the uid which your browser/device's rtc use to join.

| Param    | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
| request_id  | any uuid for tracing purpose    |
| channel_name | channel name, it needs to be the same with the one your browser/device joins, agent needs to stay with your browser/device in the same channel to communicate  |
| user_uid    | the uid which your browser/device's rtc use to join, agent needs to know your rtc uid to subscribe your audio    |
| bot_uid    | optional, the uid bot used to join rtc    |
| graph_name    | the graph to be used when starting agent, will find in property.json    |
| properties    | additional properties to override in property.json, the override will not change original property.json, only the one agent used to start    |
| timeout | determines how long the agent will remain active without receiving any pings. If the timeout is set to `-1`, the agent will not terminate due to inactivity. By default, the timeout is set to 60 seconds, but this can be adjusted using the `WORKER_QUIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` variable in your `.env` file. |

Example:
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/start' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "request_id": "c1912182-924c-4d15-a8bb-85063343077c",
    "channel_name": "test",

      }
    }
  }'

### POST /stop
This api stops the agent you started

| Param    | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
| request_id  | any uuid for tracing purpose    |
| channel_name | channel name, the one you used to start the agent  |

Example:
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/stop' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

### POST /ping
This api sends a ping to the server to indicate connection is still alive. This is not needed if you specify `timeout:-1` when starting the agent, otherwise the agent will quit if not receiving ping after timeout in seconds.
